*DESCRIPTION*:  File and Directory Creation:
The tool should enable users to create new files and directories. This involves using system calls or C++ libraries to allocate storage space and establish the necessary metadata.
File and Directory Deletion:
Users should be able to remove files and directories. The tool must handle cases where directories are not empty and provide options for recursive deletion.
File and Directory Renaming:
This feature allows users to change the names of files and directories. The tool should handle cases where the new name is already in use and provide appropriate feedback.

#OUTPUT : Output:
The output of this code will be:
Hello, this is a test file.

This output is displayed on the console after reading from the "example.txt" file.

File Created:
The code also creates a file named "example.txt" in the same directory as the executable, containing the text:
Hello, this is a test file.

The program successfully writes to and reads from the file, demonstrating basic file input/output operations in C++
